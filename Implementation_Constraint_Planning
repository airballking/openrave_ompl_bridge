**********************************
* (1) State Space Representation *
**********************************

(1.1) The space itself.
- The vectors of doubles:
-- The first vector shall represent the joint sub-space.
-- The second vector shall represent the constraint sub-space.
- Joint without limits are represented as SO2StateSpaces in OMPL.
-- The joint space differs for PR2 and HERB.

(1.2) Sampling.
- Randomized sampling shall only be done within the joint sub-space
- The values of the constraint space directely follow out of the task function.
-- TODO(GEORG): Does a function hook for this exist?

(1.3) Validity checking.
- Joint samples must fulfill joint limits and not be in collisions.
- The constraint-values must fulfill any existing path-constraints.

(1.4) Interpolation.
- Interpolation should be attempted on small increments in joint space, followed by Jacobian-based projection on any path-constraints. 

(1.5) Distance.
- TODO(GEORG): Joint space distance?

**********************************
* (2) Goal Region Representation *
**********************************

(2.1) Goal Checking.
- I will ignore any configuration-goals for the moment.
- Goal checking can be done on the constraint-values using the task function approach.
-- Requires all goal-constraints.
-- TODO(GEORG): Check whether goal regions have access to a state space.

(2.2) Sampling.
- The task function itself does not allow direct sampling of joint states which are in the goal region.
- One can sample joint states and Jacobian-project them back onto the goal region.
-- TODO(GEORG): Duplicated functionality, here?
- Dmitry sampled new goal samples with a probability P_goal to have several roots in the backwards tree. The regular RRTConnect seems to start with several goal states.
-- TODO(GEORG): Check if RRTConnect already samples the goal region to create several goal states.

(2.3) Distance.
- TODO(GEORG): Distance from goal-constraints?

**********************
* (3) Path Smoothing *
**********************

(3.1) Distance.
- Same as State Space.

(3.2) Interpolation.
- Same as State Space.

TODO(GEORG): Check if path smoothing has direct access to State Space.
